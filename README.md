# Human-Following Shopping Cart

This project implements a human-following shopping cart system, designed to autonomously follow a user using sensors and motors. The system leverages real-time data processing to detect and track the user's movement, ensuring a hands-free shopping experience.

## Features
- *Human Tracking:* Uses sensors (e.g., ultrasonic, LiDAR, or camera) to detect and follow the user.
- *Autonomous Navigation:* Motorized wheels for smooth movement.
- *Obstacle Avoidance:* Prevents collisions with objects or other shoppers.
- *Customizable Speed:* Adjusts to the walking speed of the user.

## Technologies Used
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
- Sensors (e.g., ultrasonic, infrared, or camera)
- Motor driver and motors
- Power supply
- Programming language: Python, C++ (for microcontroller)

## How It Works
1. Sensors detect the user's position relative to the cart.
2. The microcontroller processes the sensor data and calculates movement commands.
3. Motors are controlled to adjust the cart's direction and speed.
4. Obstacle avoidance logic ensures safe navigation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
